### Hello There - Greeting Cards
#### Launching this Fall

Do you hate throwing away greeting cards, but hate keeping them too?

![](assets/hellothere-promo3.png)<br><br>

We all get cards throughout the year - birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and so many more. Unfortunately most of these cards aren't kept forever. Far too often we quickly forget the thought and care that went into picking out the perfect card, writing that special note, and getting the card in the mail.

Hello There is the solution. It allows you to catalog and reference the cards you receive. You categorize them into *Folders* for the occasion, then take pictures of the front, inside, and back of the card. Add the date the card was received, who sent it, and any additional details.

Cards are stored locally on your device as well as synced to iCloud.

Designed using the latest SDKs, Hello There supports Live Text, Lockscreen Widgets, Charts, and much more.

### App Features 
• Designed with the latest iOS 16 APIs  
• Live Text makes your cards come to life  
• Charts reveal trends and sender data  
• Widgets for your home screen and lock screen  
• Card Details display the card images, who sent it, when it was received, and additional details   
• Configure portait, landscape, or square cards  
• Browse cards by occasion, by favorites, or the entire collection by date  
• Search the gallery to easily find cards by keyword    
• Cards and folders are fully editable  
• Easy to maintain *Senders* list. 
• iCloud Sync & Backup*  
• iPad support  
• Face ID / Touch ID*   
• Milestones to celebrate your progress  
• Automatic Light/Dark Mode based on device settings (configurable)  
• Custom App Icons*    
• Localization Support (English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Chinese) 

**Requires a Hello There Pro Subscription, or a one-time payment for Lifetime sub.*
