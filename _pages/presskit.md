### Hello There - Greeting Cards
#### Launching this Fall

Do you hate throwing away greeting cards, but hate keeping them too?

![](assets/hellothere-promo1.png)<br><br>

We all get cards throughout the year - birthdays, graduations, holidays, and so many more. Unfortunately many of these cards aren't kept forever. Far too often they're quickly forgotten, along with the thought and care that went into them.

Hello There is the solution. Cards are categorized into Folders for the occasion. Snap pictures of the front, inside, and back, add the date, the sender, and any additional details. Cards are displayed in whimsical stacks, optimized grids, and even on your home screen.

Designed using the latest iOS SDKs, Hello There supports Live Text, Lockscreen Widgets, Charts, Shortcuts and much more.

• Widgets for your home screen and lock screen  
• Card Details display the card images, who sent it, when it was received, and additional details   
• Configure portait, landscape, or square cards  
• Browse cards by occasion, by sender, or the entire collection by date  
• Search the gallery to easily find cards by keyword    
• Cards and folders are fully editable  
• Easy to maintain *Senders* list.
